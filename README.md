A simple check-in app that simplfies the gathering of contact tracing information. 
Built in 24hrs during the Carleton University 2021 Hackathon. 

## Why we built this: 

Storefronts need to ensure contact tracing is accurate and easy to access for government agencies in Canada. We wanted to simplify this process for businesses
so they can make it easy for their customers to give their contact information securely and quickly. 

## How it works: 

Simply sign up as a business to get a QR code generated for you. Place that QR code where customers can access it and have them scan it through our website:

Their contact data is then automatically added to our database where the business can access the information whenever they like! 


## Technology Stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: NodeJs Server
* Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
* Libraries: @material-ui, mongoose, react-qr-reader, qrcode.react
